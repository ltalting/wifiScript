# Description
A simple Powershell script that checks if there is a connection to 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS server) every 5 seconds and resets WiFi connection if there is not.

# Usage
Edit the script in a text editor and change "ALTING24" to the name of your WiFi before running the script.

# Purpose
This was made in response to an issue I was having with my WiFi constantly showing "No connection" while still being connected to the network. After trying to debug my issue for a few hours, my only solution was to turn off then turn back on my WiFi. I figured I could type this up faster than I could solve the network issue. :)
